== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize the payment types? =

Payment types are fetched from WooCommerce settings. You can update them there.

= I have a vat_number field but it doesn't show up in the vat_number options? =

The payment options include all the fields all of your orders have, so if you just created this field, for it to show up in the options, you first need to make an order using that field.

= How do I add the vat_number field through Workadu invoicing plugin? =

Unfortunately Workadu invoicing plugin doesn't have that functionality yet. To send invoices to myData (Aade) you need to have created the field by other means (many free plugins available for example) and then map the field in the wooCommerce workadu settings.

= Where can I find the invoices I created? =

All the invoices that you have created, along with many more features, are in your business account in www.app.workadu.com.

= Why is my preferred Series empty? =

You have to put a valid API key first. If you already have an API key try refreshing the page.

= How can I get my API key? =

You can find your API key in your workadu account (www.app.workadu.com), go to the buble bottom left -> settings -> users & API Keys -> api user.
