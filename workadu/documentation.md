## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: I can't find the API Key.

**Solution**: Log in to your Workadu account->settings and check the "Users & API Keys" section, your api key should be in the api user.

**Issue**: I can't create a new invoice.

**Solution**: Log in to your Workadu account and check if you have exceeded your plan's invoice limit or your free trial might have ended.

**Issue**: I can't send the new invoice to myData (Aade).

**Solution**: For an invoice to be valid for myData (Aade) these three things must apply:
1. You must have an active integration with myData (Aade) (in your Workadu account),
2. You must have added your vat number in your account settings (in your Workadu account),
3. The order must has a valid vat number, abilling address and a billing country (Wordpress).


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q**: Can I customize the payment types?

**A**: Payment types are fetched from WooCommerce settings. You can update them there.

**Q**: I have a vat_number field but it doesn't show up in the vat_number options?

**A**: The payment options include all the fields all of your orders have, so if you just created this field, for it to show up in the options, you first need to make an order using that field.

**Q**: How do I add the vat_number field through Workadu invoicing plugin?

**A**: Unfortunately Workadu invoicing plugin doesn't have that functionality yet. To send invoices to myData (Aade) you need to have created the field by other means (many free plugins available for example) and then map the field in the wooCommerce workadu settings.

**Q**: Where can I find the invoices I created?

**A**: All the invoices that you have created, along with many more features, are in your business account in www.app.workadu.com.
